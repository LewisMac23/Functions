// IntroToFunctions.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.

//Example to the Power of function

pow(10, 2)

//Data in brackets is known as the ARGUMENT, often more than one - here it is 10(arg1) to the power of 2(arg2)
//ARGUMENTS are the input POW is the machine and the output is the "RETURN"
//If function dosen't necesarilly give a value back use ";" for RETURN
//When assigning function to a variable, e.g "x" however do the below;

x = pow(10, 2);

//When you want to manipulate the function and return VALUES, e.g "func" mukltiplied by 2;

x = pow(10, 2) * 2;
//can also do this as 
x = x*2

//can use cout to output the entire result (using namespace std)

cout << x;

//The "POWER" function returns a DOUBLE - A number with decimal values after
